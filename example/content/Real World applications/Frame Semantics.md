Title: Frame Semantics and FrameNet
*/

 1. Frame Semantics:  The frames represent
story fragments, which serve to connect a group of words to a bundle of meanings

 1. A lexical unit (LU) is a pairing of a word with a meaning. Typically, each sense of a polysemous word belongs to a different semantic framee, a script-like conceptual structure that describes a particular type of situation, object, or event along with its participants and props.

1. Frame elements(FEs) are roles.

1. Frame-evoking LU is a verb and the FEs are its syntactic dependents

1. FrameNet annotations are constellations of triples that make up the frame element realization
for each annotated sentence, each consisting of a frame element (for example, Food), a grammatical function (say, Object) and a phrase type (say, NP). 

1. FrameNet includes a network of relations between frames.
